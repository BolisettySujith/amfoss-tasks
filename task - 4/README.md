# Debugging Derbies

## Installation of JAVA

- In my computer I had already installed java before doing the task . I had faced no problem while installing . 

- It's easy to install 😁 .
## How I Debugged the code🙄🧐🙄🧐 ? 


- First I had checked all the semicolons, commas, parantasis and Braces all are correctly placed  or not ?                           
     - Because there so many lines which are not having *logical syntax* .
     - I have fixed all that syntax bugs .


- Next I have checked all logical operators correctly placed or not ?       

 -  There are some bugs in the code like : Operators exchange, commiting main syntax, missing semicolons etc... 
    
- When firstly I run the code :

     >- Addition(+) operator works as Multiplication(*) operator . 

     >- Subtraction (-) operator works as Division(/) operator .

     >- Multiplication(*) operator works as Addition operator .

     >- Division(/) operator works as Subtraction(-) operator .

- I had found errors when I first run the code , and after identifying the wrongly  placed operators and arranged in their correct places .



- I had commented some unnecessary if & else statements, some main library's are commented I removed all such comments .
- After that I have corrected some loops and corrected syntax errors.

### For compiling I had used the folling two commands :
> javac MathQuiz.java 

> java MathQuiz.java
- After debugging all the errors i had run the java code but it again showing some syntax😢. In division operator it is not some in Double's.

- So, There are some problems when using integers while entering integers, that to I mainly observed in division operation because when we **divide integer values with integers we will get only integers** so I have changed all **integers** into **Double** .

- Now i have debugged all the erros afte searching for long time and I again compiled it then it successfully compiled✌🤩✌.

So the task completed successfully and I learned so many things while debugging for that i have spent a lot of time to debug this code🙂 and  I had completed .
