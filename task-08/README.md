# Sir Percevalâ€™s quest

## Procedure follwed by Me
- I have completed the all the installation of perceval with the help of choss-grimoirelab-perceval git-hub repo . 

- I have followed the commands as said to install perceval and other requirements using my **ubuntu terminal**, **I don't have a laptop so have noy installed ubuntu software**, but it works in ubuntu terminal .

- I followed the procedure for fetching the amfoss repos from github. 

- After fetching them I have saved them in **amfoss_commits_details.json file** and .

- I have to write a **python script to fetch the commits** for that i have visited book called **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python** and i have seen in **youtube** about it.

- I have written the script and saves in **perceval_commits.py**. when i have run the script with normal command


> py.exe perceval_commits.py

The command doesnot work properly, then from the suggestion of my brother I tried this command:

>  sudo python3 perceval_tests.py

it worked all the commits are outputed
## Errors
- While installing i have faced some problems ,but it completed.

- But when i am dumping i have some errors, to rectify them i have visited **greeks for greeks** and undersood some content i exiquted in that script but it's not responding .


- I have done so many time from my side it not worked properly. 


And finally the script worked and dumped to **commits.json** fileðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
