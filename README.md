## About my Tasks
when the tasks came to my email i had started doing them 2hours a day  I had exited very much when i will start doing task's , but they are some trciky and intresting and when i run a program when it gave a correct outcome i felt very happy that i made it. like that I am learning some thing every day, 10 days completed like that and suddenly i had stop doing the tasks for 11 days because of some family problems after that 11 days when i am started doing tasks it always getting some errors when doing them after a long timeand i forgot some thing's also and i get tensed whether I can do or not, with this confusion for us everyday an assignment is giving so i had complete them and  some pending assigments when i am absent also and before the one and half week of this tasks submition i am again started doing the tasks with confidence and completed some easy tasks. over all I had completed some easy tasks earned some knowledgeðŸ˜€.
